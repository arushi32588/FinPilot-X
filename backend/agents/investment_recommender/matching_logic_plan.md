ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
To match users with 2â€“4 investment options that suit their:

Profile (e.g., student, freelancer)

Financial goal (e.g., save for Goa trip, emergency fund)

Time horizon (in months)

Risk tolerance (if known)

ðŸ§© 1. Inputs to the Agent
Input	Type	Example
goal	string (NL)	"I want to save for a Goa trip in 3 months"
profile_type	enum	Student, Freelancer, Part-Time, Full-Time
risk_preference	optional enum	Low, Medium, High
available_amount	number	5000
duration_months	derived or input	3

ðŸ§  2. Matching Logic Flow

Step 1: Parse user's natural language goal (already being handled in Goal Planner)
â†’ extract goal_type & duration

Step 2: Filter `investment_mock_data.json` by:
  âœ… `duration_months` <= user duration
  âœ… `min_investment` <= available_amount
  âœ… `suitable_for` includes user's profile
  âœ… `goal_type` overlaps with user goal_type

Step 3: If risk_preference is provided, match that too
Else, default to: Student â†’ Low, Freelancer â†’ Medium, Full-Time â†’ High

Step 4: Rank filtered options by:
  - Best match on goal_type
  - Closest match to risk
  - Highest return %

Step 5: Return top 2â€“4 suggestions
